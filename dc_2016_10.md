Greetings from Maine

Functions
---------

### What is a function?

Functions gather a sequence of operations into a whole, preserving it for ongoing use. Functions provide:

-   a name we can remember and invoke it by
-   relief from the need to remember the individual operations
-   a defined set of inputs and expected outputs
-   rich connections to the larger programming environment

Let us start with a function adding two numbers:

``` r
# addition of two numbers
add <- function(a, b) {
  return(a+b)
}
```

#### Exercise 1:

Write a function of two arguments *a* and *b* that returns *a-b*, for example

``` r
substract(a=10, b=6)
```

    ## [1] 4

#### Exercise 1 extras:

First, try to predict what happens. Then copy the code to R to see the answer:

``` r
substract(10, 6)
substract(b=6, a=10)
substract(b=6, 10)
b<-6; substract(a=10)
```
