Greetings from Maine
--------------------

Before we start, please, put down your sticky notes, open a new R script (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script) and clear all objects from the memory (Environment tab -&gt; little broom icon).

And many greeting from [The Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/). Looking for a [postdoc position](https://www.jax.org/careers-and-training/career-opportunities/postdoc-positions)?

Functions
---------

### What is a function?

Functions gather a sequence of operations into a whole, preserving it for ongoing use.

Functions provide:

-   a name we can remember and invoke it by
-   relief from the need to remember the individual operations
-   a defined set of inputs and expected outputs
-   rich connections to the larger programming environment

In the morning you have learned to create a function with one argument. Now, we will continue with functions of two or more arguments.

### Functions of more than one argument

Let us start with a function adding two numbers:

``` r
# addition of two numbers
add <- function(a, b) {
  return(a+b)
}
```

#### Exercise 1:

Write a function of two arguments `a` and `b` that returns `a-b`, for example

``` r
substract(a=10, b=6)
```

    ## [1] 4

#### Exercise 1 extras:

First, try to predict what will happen. Then copy the code to R console to see the answer:

``` r
substract(10, 6)
substract(b=6, a=10)
substract(b=6, 10)
b<-6; substract(a=10)
substract(a=10, b=a)
```

### Defining defaults

And a function can have even more arguments. For example, let us create a function that calculates `price` given `cost`, `profit` and `tax`.

``` r
price <- function(cost, profit, tax=20) {
  before_tax <- cost + profit
  after_tax <- before_tax * (1 + tax/100)
  return(after_tax)
}
```

Now we can call `price` function with just two arguments

``` r
price(cost=10, profit=5)
```

    ## [1] 18

#### Exercise 2:

This is a function for an addition of four numbers:

``` r
add4 <- function(a, b, c, d) {
  return(a+b+c+d)
}

add4(1,2,3,4)
```

    ## [1] 10

Modify this function, so it will work for one, two or three arguments

``` r
add4(1,2,3)
```

    ## [1] 6

``` r
add4(1,2)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
add4(8)
```

    ## [1] 8

#### Exercise 2 extras:

First, try to predict what will happen. Then copy the code to R console to see the answer:

``` r
wrong_addition <- function(a) {
  return(a+b)
}

wrong_addition(1)
b <- 1
wrong_addition(1)
d <- wrong_addition(1)
b <- 3
d
rm(b) # removes variable b
wrong_addition(1)
d
```

### Some useful R functions

If you need a help for R function `something`, use `help(something)` or just `?something`. If you do not know the function name, try to google it (google: *R function for average*).

#### Exercise 3

What is R function for standard deviation?

``` r
# bit.ly/mousepheno is a shortcut for svenson_149.csv dataset
# see https://github.com/simecek/dc_2016_10 
dt <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/mousepheno")
